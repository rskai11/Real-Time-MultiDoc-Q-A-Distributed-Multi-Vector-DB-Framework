# Real-Time-MultiDoc-Q-A-Distributed-Multi-Vector-DB-Framework
# Overview
This project implements an advanced distributed vector database methodology to provide real-time question-and-answer capabilities across large collections of documents. By generating and leveraging multi-vector embeddings in parallel and distributing them across multiple vector databases, the system achieves efficient indexing and retrieval of pertinent information. The scalable architecture is designed to handle complex queries with high speed and accuracy, making it ideal for applications that require rapid access to diverse data sources.
